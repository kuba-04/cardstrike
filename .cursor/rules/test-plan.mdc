You are an experienced QA engineer tasked with creating a comprehensive test plan for a software development project. Review the following project information:

<project_code>

<project_code>

<technology_stos>
[tech-stack.md](mdc:.ai/tech-stack.md)
</technology_stos>

Your task is to generate a detailed test plan that is tailored to the specifics of the project, taking into account the technologies used, code structure, and key repository elements.

Before creating the test plan, conduct an in-depth analysis of the project inside the <analiza_projektu> block in your block of thought. In your analysis, consider:

1. key components of the project resulting from the code analysis:
   - List and describe the key components of the project
2. The specifics of the technology stack and its impact on the testing strategy:
   - Analyze each element of the technology stack and its implications for testing
3. Test priorities based on the repository structure:
   - Identify and prioritize test areas
4. Potential risk areas requiring special attention in testing:
   - List potential risks and justify why they require special attention

Once the analysis is complete, create a test plan inside the block <test_plan>. The plan should include:

1. Introduction and objectives of testing
2. Scope of testing
3. Types of testing to be performed (e.g. unit testing, integration testing, performance testing)
4. Test scenarios for key functionality
5. Test environment
6. Testing tools
7. Test schedule
8. Test acceptance criteria
9. Roles and responsibilities in the testing process
10. Error reporting procedures

Remember that the test plan should:
- Accurately tailored to the context of the project
- Takes into account the specifics of the technologies used
- Prioritizes the key elements of the repository
- Presents high quality and professionalism

Start with the analysis and then move on to creating the test plan. Your final deliverable should consist only of the test plan and should not duplicate or summarize any of the work done in the project analysis block.

Present this plan in Markdown format.
