Below is a sequential set of curl commands covering a happy-path workflow. In this sequence, you will:

1. Generate flashcards using the AI endpoint  
2. Accept the generated flashcard by "updating" it (simulate acceptance)  
3. Edit the accepted flashcard's details  
4. List (GET) flashcards from the flashcards table  
5. Delete the flashcard  
6. Verify that the flashcard has been deleted via a GET request

Note: In the PUT and DELETE commands, replace `<FLASHCARD_ID>` with the ID returned from your generate endpoint.

### 1. Generate Flashcard with AI

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/flashcards/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source_text": "Astro 2.0 is the first major web framework to deliver complete type-safety for Markdown and MDX. Astro now helps you organize your Markdown with built-in parsing, validation, and automatic TypeScript type generation. This new release is a game-changer for anyone working with Markdown on the web.",
    "number": 1
  }'
```

---

### 2. Accept the Generated Flashcard

_(Simulate accepting by updating the flashcardâ€™s status to "accepted")_

```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:3001/api/flashcards/b4fdc3ac-4fd2-43ab-9da0-ad755e3747c7" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "front_text": "What is the capital of France?",
    "back_text": "Paris",
    "status": "accepted"
  }'
```

---

### 3. Edit the Accepted Flashcard

_(Make further changes to the flashcard details)_

```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:3001/api/flashcards/<FLASHCARD_ID>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "front_text": "What benefits does Astro provide?",
    "back_text": "Astro delivers fast load times, server-side rendering, and a modern developer experience.",
    "status": "accepted"
  }'
```

---

### 4. List Flashcards Using GET

_(List all accepted (AI-generated) flashcards; here we use the `filter` parameter to show flashcards generated by AI)_

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/flashcards?filter=ai&page=1&limit=20&sort=created_at"
```

---

### 5. Delete the Flashcard

```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3001/api/flashcards/<FLASHCARD_ID>"
```

---

### 6. Verify Deletion by Listing Flashcards Again

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/flashcards?filter=ai&page=1&limit=20&sort=created_at"
```

This sequence represents a happy-path scenario: generating a flashcard, accepting/updating it, editing it, verifying that it appears in your flashcards table, and finally deleting it. Adjust the JSON payloads and parameters as needed based on your implementation details.
