Below is a sequential set of curl commands covering a happy-path workflow. In this sequence, you will:

1. Generate flashcards using the AI endpoint
2. Accept the generated flashcard by "updating" it (simulate acceptance)
3. Edit the accepted flashcard's details
4. List (GET) flashcards from the flashcards table
5. Delete the flashcard
6. Verify that the flashcard has been deleted via a GET request

Note: In the PUT and DELETE commands, replace `<FLASHCARD_ID>` with the ID returned from your generate endpoint.

This sequence represents a happy-path scenario: generating a flashcard, accepting/updating it, editing it, verifying that it appears in your flashcards table, and finally deleting it. Adjust the JSON payloads and parameters as needed based on your implementation details.
