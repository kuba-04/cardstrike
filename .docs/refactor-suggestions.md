Read file: ./src/lib/services/flashcards.service.ts

Read file: ./src/db/database.types.ts
Let me provide detailed refactoring suggestions for each of the top 5 files:

1. `flashcards.service.ts` (632 lines)
Refactoring suggestions:
- Split into smaller, focused services following Single Responsibility Principle:
  - `FlashcardGenerationService` - AI generation logic
  - `FlashcardStorageService` - Database operations
  - `FlashcardValidationService` - Schema validation
- Implement the Command pattern for operations
- Use dependency injection instead of direct instantiation of services
- Extract common database operations into a base repository class
- Consider using the Repository pattern for database operations
- Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Use TypeScript decorators for validation and error handling

2. `database.types.ts` (350 lines)
Refactoring suggestions:
- Split types into domain-specific files:
  - `flashcard.types.ts`
  - `user.types.ts`
  - `generation.types.ts`
- Use TypeScript utility types to reduce repetition
- Consider using a code generator for Supabase types
- Add documentation for complex type definitions
- Create separate interfaces for public API types
- Use branded types for IDs to improve type safety

3. `useFlashcardGeneration.ts` (255 lines)
Refactoring suggestions:
- Break down into smaller, focused hooks:
  - `useFlashcardValidation`
  - `useFlashcardGeneration`
  - `useFlashcardStorage`
- Implement React Query for better state management
- Extract business logic into separate service classes
- Use React Context for shared state
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add loading states and optimistic updates

4. `openrouter.service.ts` (222 lines)
Refactoring suggestions:
- Implement the Adapter pattern for different AI providers
- Use the Strategy pattern for different model configurations
- Extract API client logic into a separate class
- Implement retry logic and circuit breaker pattern
- Add proper rate limiting
- Use TypeScript generics for response types
- Implement proper error handling and logging

5. `types.ts` (135 lines)
Refactoring suggestions:
- Split into domain-specific type files
- Use TypeScript utility types to reduce duplication
- Create separate interfaces for DTOs and domain models
- Implement proper validation schemas
- Use branded types for better type safety
- Add proper JSDoc documentation
- Consider using code generation for API types

General recommendations based on the tech stack:
1. Leverage Astro's built-in optimizations:
   - Use Astro components for static content
   - Only use React for interactive components
   - Implement proper client/server component splitting

2. TypeScript improvements:
   - Enable strict mode
   - Use const assertions
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use discriminated unions for state management

3. Testing improvements:
   - Add Vitest unit tests for services
   - Implement Playwright E2E tests for critical flows
   - Use MSW for API mocking
   - Add visual regression tests

4. Performance optimizations:
   - Implement proper caching strategies
   - Use React.memo for expensive components
   - Implement proper code splitting
   - Use proper loading states

5. Code organization:
   - Follow the project structure defined in shared.mdc
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Use proper dependency injection
   - Follow the coding practices defined in the guidelines

These refactoring suggestions aim to improve code maintainability, testability, and performance while adhering to the project's established tech stack and best practices.
