# Test Plan for Cardstrike Project

## 1. Introduction and Objectives

This test plan outlines the strategy and approach for validating the functionality, integration, performance, and usability of the Cardstrike project. The objectives are to:

- Ensure all features work according to the requirements.
- Identify and address defects early.
- Verify integration between the frontend (Astro, React components) and backend (Supabase/API endpoints).
- Confirm that the application meets performance and accessibility standards.

## 2. Scope of Testing

- **Frontend Testing:** Verification of Astro pages, React interactive components, and styling with Tailwind and Shadcn/ui.
- **Backend Testing:** Testing API endpoints (located in `src/pages/api`), middleware functionalities, and database integrations (via Supabase in `src/db`).
- **Integration Testing:** End-to-end testing of the entire user journey, ensuring seamless interaction between static pages and dynamic components.
- **Cross-Platform Testing:** Validation of the application across multiple devices and browsers.
- **Regression Testing:** Ensuring that new changes don't negatively affect existing functionality.

## 3. Types of Testing to be Performed

- **Unit Testing:**
  - React component tests using Vitest with React Testing Library
  - Function and utility unit tests written in TypeScript
  - Component-specific tests for Astro components
  - Shadcn/ui component integration tests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Testing interaction between frontend components and API endpoints using Vitest
  - Integration between Astro layouts, React components, and Supabase data flows
  - API contract testing using OpenAPI validation
  - Mock Service Worker (MSW) for API mocking
- **End-to-End Testing:**
  - User flow validations using Playwright
  - Visual regression testing with Playwright's snapshot capabilities
  - Cross-browser testing across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- **Performance Testing:**
  - Core Web Vitals monitoring using web-vitals library
  - Assessing page load times and responsiveness using Lighthouse
  - Bundle size monitoring with bundlesize or size-limit
  - Astro partial hydration performance metrics
  - Supabase query performance monitoring
- **Security Testing:**
  - Verifying authentication flows via Supabase
  - Automated security scanning with OWASP ZAP or Snyk
  - API fuzzing tests
  - CORS and CSP validation
  - Rate limiting tests for API endpoints
- **Accessibility Testing:**
  - Automated testing using axe-core
  - Screen reader compatibility testing
  - Keyboard navigation testing
  - Color contrast and responsive design validation
  - WCAG 2.1 compliance checking

## 4. Test Scenarios for Key Functionality

- **User Interface:**
  - Verify that all Astro pages and React components render correctly across different browsers.
  - Validate that Tailwind styles and Shadcn/ui components are applied consistently.
- **Navigation & Routing:**
  - Test navigation between pages, including internal and external links.
  - Validate error states (404, 500) and proper redirection.
- **API & Data Interaction:**
  - Test API endpoints for correct data retrieval, submission, and error handling.
  - Confirm proper data integration between frontend components and the Supabase backend.
- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Verify user authentication flows and secure access to protected routes.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Validate that error messages are user-friendly and log detailed errors for troubleshooting.
- **Performance & Load:**
  - Test response times and application performance under various load conditions.

## 5. Test Environment

- **Development Environment:** Local environment for initial testing and daily development.
- **Staging Environment:** A production-mirrored environment for integration, performance, and end-to-end tests.
- **Browser/Devices:** Test across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and ensure mobile responsiveness on iOS and Android devices.
- **Data:** Use a representative dataset that simulates production-like scenarios, with logging enabled for error tracking.

## 6. Testing Tools

- **Unit & Integration Testing:**
  - Vitest as the primary test runner
  - React Testing Library for component testing
  - @testing-library/user-event for user interaction simulation
  - MSW for API mocking
  - @testing-library/jest-dom for enhanced assertions
- **End-to-End Testing:**
  - Playwright for cross-browser testing
  - Playwright Test for visual regression
- **Performance Testing:**
  - Lighthouse
  - web-vitals
  - bundlesize/size-limit
- **Static Analysis & Linting:**
  - ESLint
  - TypeScript
  - type-coverage for TypeScript coverage metrics
- **Security Testing:**
  - OWASP ZAP
  - Snyk
- **Monitoring & Error Tracking:**
  - Sentry for error tracking
  - Custom logging solutions
- **Bug Tracking:**
  - GitHub Issues or Jira for defect management
  - Automated issue creation from test failures

## 7. Test Schedule

- **Planning & Setup:** Define test cases, prepare test environments, and set up testing tools. (Week 1)
- **Unit & Integration Testing:** Ongoing parallel to development. (Weeks 1-4)
- **End-to-End & Performance Testing:** Conducted in staging prior to major releases. (Weeks 3-5)
- **Regression Testing:** Continuous testing during release candidate phases.
- **Final Acceptance:** Complete full test run before production deployment.
