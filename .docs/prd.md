# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - CardStrike Flashcards

## 1. Product overview

CardStrike Flashcards is a web-based flashcard application designed to facilitate efficient learning through spaced repetition. The application leverages AI to generate flashcards from user-provided plain text, in addition to supporting manual flashcard creation. The system features flashcard review, management (viewing, editing, and deleting), and a basic user account system for secure storage and personalized learning experiences.

## 2. User problem

Manually creating high-quality learning flashcards is time-consuming, which discourages users from employing effective learning methods such as spaced repetition. Users need a streamlined process that offers automated flashcard generation via AI and supports manual creation, ensuring both ease of use and secure storage of their study materials.

## 3. Functional requirements

1. AI-driven flashcard generation:

   - Accept any plain text input, regardless of language.
   - Automatically generate flashcard pairs ("front" and "back") using AI: The application sends text to the LLM model via the API.
   - Display AI-generated flashcards in a review interface where users can accept, edit, or reject each candidate.
   - Bulk save accepted flashcards after completion of the review process.
   - Mark AI-generated flashcards with a distinctive icon (ai_icon.png).

2. Manual flashcard creation:

   - Provide a plain text interface for users to input both sides of a flashcard.
   - Allow immediate viewing, editing, and deletion of all created flashcards.

3. Flashcard management:

   - Enable users to view, edit, and delete flashcards in their collection.

4. User account system:

   - Support basic registration, authentication, and password recovery functionalities.
   - Securely store user-specific flashcards and session data.
   - Possibility of deleting your account and associated flashcards on request.

5. Spaced repetition integration:

   - Provision of a mechanism to assign flashcards to a repetition schedule (use of a ready-made open source algorithm)
   - Lack of additional metadata and advanced notification features in MVP.

6. Storage and scalability:

   - Flashcards and user data stored in a way that ensures scalability and security.

7. Flashcards generation statistics:

   - Gathering information on how many flashcards were generated by AI and how many of them were eventually accepted.

8. Legal requirements and restrictions:
   - Personal data of users and flashcards stored in accordance with the RODO.
   - Right to inspect and delete data (account including flashcards) upon user request.

## 4. Product boundaries

- Excluded from the MVP:
  - Customized or advanced prioprietary repetition algorithms (we will use open source library).
  - Import functionality for multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
  - Sharing of flashcard sets between users.
  - Integrations with other learning platforms.
  - Mobile applications; the initial release is web-only.
  - Advanced features such as rich metadata, text normalization, extended repetition algorithms, auditing, and speech-to-text functionalities.

## 5. user stories

US-001
Title: AI Flashcard Generation
Description: As a user, I want to input plain text to generate flashcards via AI, review them, and bulk save accepted flashcards.
Acceptance Criteria:

- In the flashcards generation view, there is a text field where the user can paste their text.
- The text field expects between 100 and 10,000 characters.
- When the user clicks the generate button, the application communicates with the LLM model's API and displays a list of generated flashcards proposals for the user to accept.
- If there are problems with the API or if the model does not respond, the user will see an appropriate error message.

US-002
Title: Manual Flashcard Creation
Description: As a user, I want to manually create flashcards by entering both the question and answer through a plain text interface.
Acceptance Criteria:

- A form is provided for manual entry of both sides of the flashcard.
- Newly created flashcards appear immediately in the flashcard list.
- Users can edit or delete their manually created flashcards.
- Created flashcards are immediately saved in the database.

US-003
Title: Flashcard Management
Description: As a user, I want to view, edit, and delete flashcards in my collection to keep my study materials up-to-date.
Acceptance Criteria:

- A comprehensive flashcard list is available to the user.
- Options for editing and deleting are provided for each flashcard.
- Changes are saved and accurately reflected in the flashcard list.

US-004
Title: Learning session with repetition algorithm
Description: as a logged-in user, I want the added flashcards to be available in a ‘Learning Session’ view based on an external algorithm, in order to be able to learn efficiently (spaced repetition).
Acceptance criteria:

- In the ‘Learning Session’ view, the algorithm prepares a learning session of flashcards for me.
- At the start, the front of the card is displayed, through interaction the user displays the back of the card
- The user evaluates, according to the algorithm, how much he/she has learned of the card
- The algorithm then displays the next card in the learning session

US-005
Title: AI-Generated Flashcard Indicator
Description: As a user, I want to clearly see which flashcards are generated by AI so that I can differentiate them from manually created ones.
Acceptance Criteria:

- AI-generated flashcards display a special icon (ai_icon.png) consistently across all views.
- The indicator is visible during both the review process and regular flashcard management.

US-006
Title: Multilingual and Inclusive Flashcard Creation
Description: As a multilingual user, I want to input plain text in any language or script so that the system can generate flashcards that accurately display non-Latin characters and phonetic inputs.
Acceptance Criteria:

- The text input accepts a wide range of characters from different languages.
- Generated flashcards display correct formatting for non-Latin alphabets and special characters.
- The AI generation process is robust across various languages.

US-007
Title: User Registration
Description: As a new user, I want to register an account so that I can securely store and manage my flashcards.
Acceptance Criteria:

- The registration form accepts a valid email and password.
- A confirmation email is sent upon successful registration.
- All required fields are validated appropriately.

US-008

- The notification clearly explains the limitation and encourages users to log in or register for full access.
- The application maintains the state of the session to ensure that the user cannot generate flashcards again until they log in or refresh the session.
- The session state is stored in session storage or a relevant mechanism, ensuring that the limitation persists across page refreshes.
