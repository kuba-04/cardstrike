# OpenRouter Service Implementation Plan

## 1. Service Description

This OpenRouter Service acts as an intermediary between LLM-based chatbots and the OpenRouter API. It is responsible for constructing requests that combine system prompts, user messages, and model parameters, sending them to the OpenRouter API, and processing the structured responses. 

## 2. Constructor Description

The constructor will initialize the service with necessary configuration parameters. It will:

- Accept API credentials (e.g., API keys) and endpoint URLs through environment variables or configuration files.
- Set default properties such as the system message, model name, model parameters (temperature, max_tokens, etc.), and the response format.
- Initialize the HTTP client and logger for API communication and error tracking.

## 3. Public Methods and Fields

### Public Methods

1. **sendRequest(userMessage: string): Promise<ResponseData>**
   - Constructs the complete API request payload.
   - Includes the system message, user message, and any additional context.
   - Invokes a private method to execute the HTTP request and returns the parsed response.

2. **configure(config: ServiceConfig): void**
   - Updates configuration parameters dynamically (e.g., system message, model name, model parameters, response format).
   - Allows for runtime adjustments without needing a service restart.

### Public Fields

- **defaultSystemMessage: string** – The baseline prompt that guides the model's behavior.
- **modelName: string** – The designated model name for the API (e.g., "gpt-4o-mini", "openrouter-GPT4").
- **responseFormat: ResponseFormat** – Defines the expected structured response, for example:
  ```json
  { "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": { "name": "OpenRouterResponse", "strict": true, "schema": { "message": "string", "usage": "number" } } }
  ```
- **apiUrl: string** – URL of the OpenRouter API endpoint.

## 4. Private Methods and Fields

### Private Methods

1. **_buildPayload(userMessage: string): RequestPayload**
   - Integrates the default system message, provided user message, and any dynamic model parameters into a structured payload.
   - Embeds the `response_format` configuration to ensure the API returns a JSON schema conforming response.

2. **_executeRequest(payload: RequestPayload): Promise<ResponseData>**
   - Manages the HTTP request to the OpenRouter API using a robust client (e.g., Axios or Fetch API).
   - Implements retry logic, handles HTTP timeouts, and logs all request/response details.

3. **_parseResponse(apiResponse: any): ResponseData**
   - Validates the API response against the pre-defined JSON schema in the response format.
   - Transforms and returns the response in a strongly-typed object expected by the chatbot application.

### Private Fields

- **_httpClient** – Configured HTTP client for making API calls, including headers and timeout settings.
- **_logger** – Logging service to capture debug information and errors for troubleshooting.

## 5. Error Handling

Potential error scenarios and solutions include:

1. **Network Errors (Timeouts, Connection Issues)**
   - *Solution:* Implement retry logic and fallback mechanisms with exponential backoff.

2. **Invalid Response Format**
   - *Solution:* Validate the response against the JSON schema. If validation fails, throw a descriptive error.

3. **Authentication Errors (401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden)**
   - *Solution:* Ensure API keys are securely stored and refreshed. Provide clear error messages and prompt for re-authentication when needed.

4. **Resource Not Found (404 Errors)**
   - *Solution:* Log detailed information and supply a fallback response or error message to the user.

5. **Unexpected Server Errors (500 Errors and beyond)**
   - *Solution:* Capture detailed logs for debugging and return user-friendly error messages.

## 6. Security Issues

- **API Credentials:** Store sensitive information, like API keys, in environment variables. Avoid hardcoding.
- **Communication:** All API requests should be made over HTTPS to ensure secure transmission.
- **Logging:** Avoid logging sensitive data. Only record necessary error and debug information.
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize all input to prevent injection attacks. Use strict type checking and validation libraries.
- **Rate Limiting:** Incorporate rate limiting to prevent abuse and mitigate denial-of-service risks.

## 7. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Set up environment variables for API credentials and endpoint configuration.
   - Install necessary libraries for HTTP client functionality (e.g., Axios) and logging.

2. **Service Skeleton Development**
   - Create the service class with its constructor, public methods (`sendRequest`, `configure`), and private helpers (`_buildPayload`, `_executeRequest`, `_parseResponse`).
   - Define default values for system message, model name, and response format according to the API requirements.

3. **Payload Construction**
   - Implement the `_buildPayload` method to construct the request payload.
   - Ensure that the payload includes:
     - **System Message:** e.g., "You are a helpful assistant."
     - **User Message:** The dynamic input from the chatbot's user.
     - **Response Format:** For example:
       ```json
       { "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": { "name": "OpenRouterResponse", "strict": true, "schema": { "message": "string", "usage": "number" } } }
       ```

4. **HTTP Request Execution**
   - Develop the `_executeRequest` method to send the payload to the OpenRouter API.
   - Integrate model parameters such as model name and custom parameters (temperature, max_tokens, etc.) into the request.
   - Implement error handling and retry mechanisms.

5. **Response Parsing and Validation**
   - Implement the `_parseResponse` function to validate the API response against the expected JSON schema.
   - Transform and return the response in a format that the chatbot can utilize.

6. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - Add error detection and logging throughout the service. Address network errors, invalid responses, authentication failures, and unexpected server errors.
   - Provide clear documentation and user feedback on error states.
